    "# Introduction to Molecular Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical molecular dynamics (MD), a simulation engine numerically integrates Newton's equations of motion to move particles through time.  The general process is similar to the previous simulation example of the ball falling from rest.  Since acceleration is the change in velocity over time, and velocity is the change in position over time, we can therefore evolve the position of particles in the system.  However,  instead of a constant acceleration due to gravity, acceleration results from the interaction between particles in the system following the relationship $F = ma$, where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass and $a$ is acceleration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's equations represent a set of 'N' second order differential equations (where 'N' corresponds to the number of particles). There are many ways in which to perform the numerical integration, some better than others in terms of stability and precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Velocity Verlet algorithm\n",
    "This method is a commonly used, robust scheme, e.g., used in packages such [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov).   The Velocity Verlet algorithm updates the position at time $t+\\delta t$  based on the velocity ($\\vec{v_i}$) and force at the current time $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{r_i}(t+\\delta t) = \\vec{r_i}(t) + \\vec{v_i}(t)\\delta t + \\frac{1}{2m_i}\\vec{F_i}(t)\\delta t^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity is updated using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{v_i}(t+\\delta t) = \\vec{v_i}(t) + \\frac{1}{2m_i}\\left[\\vec{F_i}(t)+\\vec{F_i}(t+\\delta t)\\right]\\delta t$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For more detail information see [David Kofke's lecture slides on the Velocity Verlet algorithm (and other integration methods).](https://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~kofke/ce530/Lectures/Lecture11/sld041.htm) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "Modify the ball falling code (included below) to use the Velocity Verlet algorithm to update positions.  Here we will assume that the force acting on the ball follows $F=ma$ where we can assume the ball is of mass 'm' (note mass will cancel out in the equation, thus we do not actually need to define it). Also note, since this ball experiences a constant acceleration, the force is constant throughout time.  \n",
    "* Use the ```height_array_vv``` to store the position for the Velocity Verlet algorithm and the ```velocity_array_vv``` to store the velocity for the Velocity Verlet algorithm. You can leave the other code in place for comparison.\n",
    "* If you have done this correctly, the output plots on the right hand column will be identical to the left hand column. "

Recall in the example of the falling ball, if the timestep were too large we would miss the important features of the trajectory; the same general concept applies to MD simulations.  A general rule of thumb is that timestep should be ~1/10 the highest frequency.  Since C-H bond stretching tends to be the fastest mode ($10^{-14}$ s), a 1 fs timestep is often our limit for atomistic systems.  \n",

    "## Speeding things up \n",
    "### Cutoffs\n",
    "You may notice that the LJ potential shown above, quickly starts approaching zero.  A way to reduce computational cost is to simply ignore any particles that are beyond a certain cutoff distance, typically denoted $r_c$.  The value of this cutoff (and how the potential is actually cutoff), will alter the results slightly. Long range corrections to the potential energy can be applied (e.g., that use a mean field approximation) that are able to closely approximate the \"true\" potential energy of the system.  Commonly employed cutoffs you will find in the literature: \n",
    "\n",
    ">- $2.24\\sigma$ \n",
    "> * The minimum of the LJ potential occurs at $2^{(1/6)}\\sigma \\sim 1.12\\sigma$, thus this cutoff is twice the minimum.\n",
    "> * However, this cutoff tends to only appear in older literature; the shorter cutoff was likely used as a means to speed up a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    ">- $2.5\\sigma$\n",
    "> * This corresponds to a point where the potential is quite small, $<$ 1/60 of the strength of the maximum well depth.  This is quite common, especially for coarse-grained models.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">- 12 to 15 angstroms. \n",
    "> * Many atomistic force fields apply a single cutoff for all species and not modulated by the characteristic $\\sigma$ of an atom. For reference, $\\sigma$ for carbon is ~3.5 angstroms, making this cutoff about 3.4 to 4.3 times $\\sigma$. In many cases, force field parameters have been optimized and validated using a specific cutoff value (and thus users should refer to the force field documentation/publications for the appropriate choice).  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often not desirable to simply truncate the potential. One approach is to shift the force field such that the value is zero at the cutoff and thus avoiding a discontinuity (shifting can be done to either the force or the potential).  Note, if the force field is shifted it will slightly alter the well-depth of the potential and result in subtle differences as compared to an unshifted force field. Other approachs, such as smoothing algorithms and switching functions that do not alter the well-depth, can also be used to handle cutoff interactions (e.g., see xplor in HOOMD-Blue).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborlists\n",
    "While employing a cutoff will reduce the number of times the code must calculate the interaction potential, calculating the distance between all pairs of particles in the system is still costly.  To avoid this calculation, a neighborlist can be constructed that includes all particles within the cutoff + buffer (the buffer is often called the \"skin\"). The general idea is that the local environment of a particle changes rather slowly, and thus the same neighborlist can be applied multiple times before needing to be reconstructed.   \n",

    "#### The frequency of reconstruction will depend on numerous factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "How fast  the system is changing. \n",
    "> This is often a consequence of the phase, where, for example gas phases will change much more rapidly than dense fluids.  Similarly, temperature will play a role, where high temperature systems will have particles moving faster than low temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the buffer/skin. \n",
    "> If this is set too small, the neighborlist will need to be rebuilt very frequently, if too large, the computational savings will be minimal as the list will contain a very large number of particles.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, setting the parameters incorrectly for the neighborlist can result in interactions being missed and systems crashing. Simulation packages often include checks when the list is rebuilt, to identify cases where a particle may have moved \"too much\" (i.e., greater than the size of the skin) and thus interactions may have been missed. These are often referred to as \"Dangerous Builds.\" This will be discussed in a later tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the frequency that a neighborlist is rebuilt can be set to occur at a set time interval, or be made dynamic (including an additional check that if any particle moves more than half the size of the buffer, the list should be rebuilt).  Various algorithms can be used for speeding up construction of the neighborlist (appropriateness depends on the application). Quoting from the HOOMD-Blue documentation (http://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/stable/module-md-nlist.html):  \n",
    "\n",
    "```The simplest way to build a neighbor list is O(N^2): each particle loops over all other particles and only includes those within the neighbor list cutoff. This algorithm is no longer implemented in HOOMD-blue because it is slow and inefficient. Instead, three accelerated algorithms based on cell lists and bounding volume hierarchy trees are implemented. The cell list implementation is fastest when the cutoff radius is similar between all pair forces (smaller than 2:1 ratio). The stencil implementation is a different variant of the cell list, and is usually fastest when there is large disparity in the pair cutoff radius and a high number fraction of particles with the bigger cutoff (at least 30%). The tree implementation is faster when there is large size disparity and the number fraction of big objects is low. Because the performance of these algorithms depends sensitively on your system and hardware, you should carefully test which option is fastest for your simulation.```\n"
