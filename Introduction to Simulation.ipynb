    "As a simple example of a developing a model and performing a simulation, consider a classic physics problem: a ball falling from rest. \n",

    "#### Let us first consider the most basic model.  This model requires two key rules in order to perform a simulation:\n",
    ">* The ball accelerates due to gravity (g = $9.8 m/s^2$) \n",
    ">* The displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time can be related by the kinematic equations of motion:\n",

    "This script will log the velocity (```velocity_array```) and height (```height_array```) of the ball as a function of time (```time_array```) and plot the results at the end. Note, that this script numerically evaluates the velocity and displacement at discrete points in time, spaced by the \"timestep\" (dt). \n",
    ">- If the timestep is very large, the simulation will miss important details about the motion of the ball (e.g., missing the collision with the ground). \n",
    ">- The smaller the timestep, the finer the resolution, although the longer the simulation will take (for such a simple model, computational cost is not really an issue, but certainly is for molecular simulations). \n",
    "\n",
    "This example starts with the ball at a height of 10 meters (```height_i = 10.0 ```) and an initial velocity of 0 m/s (```velocity_i = 0.0```).  These parameters could easily be changed to perform the simulation under different conditions; the model/rules do not need to change, only the input conditions to the simulation.  "
