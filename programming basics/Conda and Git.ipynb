    "\n",
    "\"Conda is an open source **package management system** and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and z/OS. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal environment.\"\n",
    "</br>\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Git- from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/what-is-git)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Git is a distributed **version control** system. This means that a local clone of the project is a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git's flexibility and popularity make it a great choice for any team. Many developers and college graduates already know how to use Git. Git's user community has created many resources to train developers and Git's popularity make it easy to get help when needed. Nearly every development environment has Git support and Git command line tools run on every major operating system.\"\n",
