    "### Simple, brute force neighborlist\n",
    "Recall that, to avoid having to perform this distance calculation every timesteps, a neighborlist can instead be constructed that includes all particles within the cutoff + buffer (the buffer is often called the \"skin\"). The general idea is that the local environment of a particle changes rather slowly, and thus the same neighborlist can be applied multiple times before needing to be reconstructed, thus reducing the computation. The construction of the neighborlist is still $O(N^2)$ (i.e., it's often called \"brute force\"), but it is done less frequently thus providing speed improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell list-based neighborlist\n",
    "To improve upon the brute force neighborlist, a cell list can first be constructed, and this cell list used to generate the neighborlist.  A cell list is constructed by gridding the system up into smaller boxes, where each edge length is typically $\\ge r_c+buffer$.  Cell lists can be constructed relatively inexpensively by binning particles in each direction. The neighborlist is then constructed for a given particle by looping over the cell it is in and it's neighbor cells (note, since pair potentials are pair-wise additive, we only need to consider half of the cells; that is, if A is a neighbor of B, then B is a neighbor of A). \n",
    "\n",
    "For efficiency, some codes allow multiple cell lists in a system; this can be especially useful if your system has interactions/particle sizes that are very different; if a single neighborlist were used, it would need to be based on the largest interaction cutoff, thus negating speed increases for particles with shorter range interactions. \n",

    "\n",
    "How fast  the system is changing. \n",
    "> This is often a consequence of the phase, where, for example gas phases will change much more rapidly than dense fluids.  Similarly, temperature will play a role, where high temperature systems will have particles moving faster than low temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the buffer/skin. \n",
    "> If this is set too small, the neighborlist will need to be rebuilt very frequently, if too large, the computational savings will be minimal as the list will contain a very large number of particles.   \n",
    "To speed things up, we can generate a neighborlist, which is a list of particles within our interaction cutoff (i.e., $r_c$) with some \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The neighborlist has two basic parameters: (1) the skin size (i.e, buffer) and (2) the frequency of updating/checking for updates. These two parameters are coupled; for example, a system with high mobility may require a larger skin to avoid needing to be updated the neighborlist every timestep and to ensure particle interactions are not missed."

    "### The Skin\n",
    "The skin is used to create a buffer of particles that are close by, but just outside of the interaction cutoff. This increases the number of calculations that must be done, since we still need to calculate the distance with all particles in the neighborlist even if a particle is ultimately be outside of the interaction range. However, by including this buffer of particles, neighborlists need to be updated less frequently, since we are basically keeping track of the location of nearby particles that we may interact with in the near future.\n",

    "### Updating Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "In most codes, you have two ways of enforcing an update of the neighborlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one approach is to specify that the neighborlist be updated every N steps. This approach tends to work well for systems that are dense or slowly moving, as particle motion should be relatively uniform in the system. However, this may make it challenging to balance wanting to reduce the number of updates that are done and ensuring that particles don't move too far, resulting in missed interactions (i.e., dangerous builds). This approach can speed things up, but should be considered \"less safe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to check the displacement of particles. The general rule is that a neighborlist needs to be rebuilt if any particle has move more than skin/2.0, such to ensure that particle interactions are not being missed. This helps to ensure that \"dangerous builds\" aren't present in the system (See below). In many codes this also can be couple \"checking\" with a time modulation, e.g., only check every N timesteps.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most codes will output a summary of the total number of dangerous builds, that is, the total number of times it built the neighborlist was rebuilt with particles move greater than skin/2.0. In such cases, interactions may be missed, resulting in misleading and incorrect behavior.  \n",

In more extreme cases of missed interactions, systems may crash due to particles moving outside the bounds of the simulation cell (usually due to extremely high forces on the particles). \n",
