    "Recall there are many packages available to perform MD simulations often with different features and meant to support different system types. A few of the common codes include:\n",
    "* [LAMMPS](http://LAMMPS.sandia.gov)\n",
    "* [GROMACS](http://gromacs.org)\n",
    "* [HOOMD-Blue](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/)\n",
    "* [NAMD](https://www-s.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)\n",

    "### Basic components of most script/control files\n",
    "In general, MD simulation engines require the same basic information to be passed to the code, even if the format varies.  We can roughly break these inputs up into four main categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### system initialization \n",
    ">definition of the box size, how many particles, particle types, particle initial positions, what particles are bonded to each other, the periodicity, and other system context information.  Typically, this involves providing the name of an data file that defines the system configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### interaction definition \n",
    ">the functional and associated parameters form describing how different species interact with each other, cell/neighborlist information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### integrator setup\n",
    ">what algorithm will we use to advance particles in time, time step of integration, thermodynamic state point (i.e., T and/or P).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### runtime parameters \n",
    ">total simulation time, frequency of writing thermodynamic quantities and/or system configuration data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "In general, each simulation engines employs its own unique syntax and file format for defining the inputs to the code.  While there is a growing trend of providing Python interfaces for the software, there still is not a uniform syntax or API for initializing simulations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, LAMMPS uses its own custom scripting language to define the simulation inputs, as well as their own novel file format for defining the configuration of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, HOOMD-Blue and OpenMM allow users to define the inputs and interact with the software using Python.  However, despite both codes using Python, their APIs are not interchangeable; that is, a HOOMD-Blue python script could not be used to setup and perform a OpenMM simulation. The codes also utilize different file formats for defining the system configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools such as GROMACS and NAMD rely upon a different approach altogether, using a control files (files that define keys and their associated values) to define simulation run parameters and methods, rather than scripts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMM is somewhat unique in that it provides routines to read not only their file format, but also AMBER, GROMACS, and CHARMM data files that contain configurations and force field information. However, a user must still write their own script file (support is not provided to automatically convert, e.g., a GROMACS .mdp control files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this means that switching between different simulation engines is often non-trivial, requiring users to generate new data files and scripts for each code they may wish to use.  As will be discussed later, the [MosDeF](mosdef.org) toolkit has been developed to help address some of these issues in terms of making it easier to generate parameterized data files for different simulation engines and ensuring that such files are accurate.  \n",

This example is adapted from the tutorial found on in [HOOMD-Blue documentation](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.0/tutorial/01-Introducing-Molecular-Dynamics/01-Molecular-Dynamics-Simulations.html) which provides a detailed examination of the structure of the script file. Note, the simulation configuration is defined in the file 'lj.gsd' which was created using the [mBuild library](mbuild.mosdef.org), which will be discussed in more detail later in the cybercamp. \n",

    "As we saw in the example of the ball falling, if we use too large of a timestep (dt), we miss important details.  In the ball falling example, we were not being able to precisely identify when the ball contacts the ground.  For an MD simulation, the same type of issue can occur if the timestep is too large; typically, this means that particles move too close together, resulting in in extremely larger forces between particles in the system causing system failure (i.e., the system to \"blow up\").   The code below plots the LJ interaction as a function of distance (showing both the energy, `U` and force, `F`), where we can see the force grows very rapidly as the separation reduces below the value of sigma (here, $\\sigma= 1$).
