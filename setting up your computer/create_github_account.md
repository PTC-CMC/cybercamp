# Welcome to CyberCamp 2022

Below is the instruction to help you create a GitHub account.


## Create your GitHub account

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in sources code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work and can be used to track changes in any set of files. GitHub is a company (owned by Microsoft) that provides hosting service for software development and version control using Git. **Git and GitHub are independent identities.**  

The materials for this class are available on GitHub and use Git to track all the changes. Hence, you will need to have a GitHub account to participate in activities in this camp. 

If you do not have a GitHub account, access https://github.com/ and click the “Sign Up” button on the top right of the page. You should be able to create an account by following the instructions from that site.
